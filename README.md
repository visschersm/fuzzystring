*Project Description*

FuzzyString is a library developed for use in my day job for reconciling naming conventions between different models of the electric grid. I have stripped off the power system specific code and put together what can effectively be used as a string extension for determining approximate equality between two strings. All of the algorithms used here have been pulled from online resources, translated into C#, and compiled into this library. I found several other similar open-source implementations around but nothing for .NET/C#. Adding the *.dll to your project will give you access to this extension and the individual extensions under the hood of the ApproximatelyEquals() extension.
